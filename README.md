# grid-8px

Shows an 8px [document grid](https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/grids.html) in your browser like the one I use in Sketch. Toggle with Ctrl+g or hold down Alt/Option key.

Load the script through [Rawgit](http://rawgit.com/) using 
  - https://cdn.rawgit.com/tomger/grid-8px/master/grid-8px.js (auto updates)
  - https://cdn.rawgit.com/tomger/grid-8px/0.1/grid-8px.js (never updates)

You can automatically load the script with the extension. You'll have to put it on your disk and load the unpacked extension yourself. It's $5 to put it in the store.
